# simon_clone
My electronic clone of the 1980's Milton Bradley game "Simon", written in plain HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS. The game allows for a slow and fast mode with regards to the sequence speed, a strict mode wherein mistakes cause you to lose the game (otherwise, the round replays), and has sound effects on the buttons, incorrect answers, a loss, and for a win.
