# Old Simon Clone
An electronic clone of the 1980's Milton Bradley game "Simon", written in plain HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The game allows for a slow and fast mode with regards to the sequence speed, a strict mode wherein mistakes cause you to lose the game (otherwise, the round replays), and user initiated and automatic resets (auto after win/loss).
